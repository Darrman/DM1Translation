YU-GI-OH DUEL MONSTERS
ENGLISH TRANSLATION

This patch serves to translate the game Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters into English.
The translation is complete, and all text in the game is in English.
Please note that the translation is not American English, so do not report
words like "colour" being spelled as such as typos.

Patching Instructions:
Apply "DM1.ips" to a clean rom of Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters.
I recommend using Lunar IPS, available from Romhacking.net.
Ensure that the rom has been removed from any zip before patching.

Card names are based on the Dark Duel Stories names, though abbreviations
were modified as I saw fit.
Eg: Frog the Jam, not Slime Toad
Character names are the 4Kids ones.
Eg: Joey Wheeler, not Katsuya Jonouchi


Known Issues:
Some card names have spaces removed due to rom space limitations.
Others are shortened due to screen space limits.
Character names in the records menu have a limit of 8, so the Puppeteer is
known as "Puppeter" due to them.
Otherwise, everything is working as intended.

Passwords:
Some cards have passwords, and they don't use the real-world ones.
I will detail the English inputs here. Each password can only be used once.
Note they are case-sensitive and the character limit is 8.
Since the original passwords were developer names, I've used their first
names as the passwords here.

Kazuki = Fairy's Gift
Nobuhiro = Flying Penguin
Satoshi = Megasonic Eye
Takuri = Takriminos
Kanako = Kanan the Swordmistress
Yosihisa = Yaranzo
Kazumi = Stuffed Animal
Kazuhiko = Seiyaryu
Tosimasa = Three-Legged Zombies

Please report any bugs not present in the known issues.
Have fun in your duels.
