# YU-GI-OH DUEL MONSTERS
# ENGLISH TRANSLATION

This patch serves to translate the game Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters into English.
Currently, the translation is not complete, though the game is fully playable.
At this moment of time, the character dialogue currently contains placeholder
text in the vein of "Yugi battle" and "Yugi defeated".
Card descriptions are based off of the descriptions found on Yugipedia,
shortened down to fit by myself.
In-duel text describes the effects that occur, but requires proper revision.
The in-game credits remain entirely in Japanese.

Patching Instructions:
Apply "DM1.ips" to a clean rom of Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters.
I recommend using Lunar IPS, available from Romhacking.net.
Ensure that the rom has been removed from any zip before patching.

All Yugipedia DM1 pages were split out by Deltaneos.
The edits where the pages were split also appear to be where the English
descriptions originate from, outside of several uses of TCG descriptions.
Card names are based on the Dark Duel Stories names, though abbreviations
were modified as I saw fit.
Character names are the 4Kids ones. (Joey, Tea, etc.)
Special thanks to Mantidactyle and Dinoguy1000 for the RHDN Datacrystal page,
which I frequently used as a point of reference.

Known Issues:
When scrolling through the trunk/deck, the menu label reverts to Japanese.
It displays in English when first entering the menu and when backing out of
a card description.
The record screen is the opposite: random letters appear next to the number of
people duelled, but scrolling back and forth will clear it up.
The character limit in this screen is 8, so character last names are dropped.
"Puppeteer" also had to be clipped down to "Puppeter".

Passwords:
Some cards have passwords, and they don't use the real-world ones.
I will detail the English inputs here. Each password can only be used once.
Note they are case-sensitive and the character limit is 8.
Since the original passwords were developer names, I've used their first
names as the passwords here.

Kazuki = Fairy's Gift
Nobuhiro = Flying Penguin
Satoshi = Megasonic Eye
Takuri = Takriminos
Kanako = Kanan the Swordmistress
Yosihisa = Yaranzo
Kazumi = Stuffed Animal
Kazuhiko = Seiyaryu
Tosimasa = Three-Legged Zombies

Want to Help?:
A translator is required for the character dialogue and duel text.
I also want the card descriptions to be revised for accuracy.
If you know Japanese and are willing to translate any of these things,
please send me a message on Romhacking.net (I'm Darrman) and reply to the
thread I've posted in Help Wanted Ads.
https://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?topic=33490.0
From there, we can discuss further details. There's about 30KB of dialogue,
15KB of duel text, and 80KB of card descriptions.

Please report any bugs not present in the known issues.
Have fun in your duels.
